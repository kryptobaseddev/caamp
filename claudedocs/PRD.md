## 1. Executive Summary

CAAMP (Central AI Agent Managed Packages) is a TypeScript CLI and library that provides a unified provider registry and package manager for AI coding agents. It is the first tool to combine Skills management, MCP server configuration, instruction file injection, and config format handling into a single CLI -- bridging the gap between 28 AI coding agents that each use different configuration formats, directory structures, and conventions.

The AI coding agent ecosystem in early 2026 is fragmented. Each agent -- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and 22 others -- stores MCP server configurations in different files, different formats (JSON, JSONC, YAML, TOML), under different keys (`mcpServers`, `mcp_servers`, `extensions`, `mcp`, `servers`, `context_servers`), and reads instruction files from different filenames (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`). CAAMP eliminates this fragmentation with a single source of truth.

CAAMP ships as both a CLI (`npm install -g @cleocode/caamp` or `npx @cleocode/caamp <command>`) and a library (`import { ... } from "@cleocode/caamp"`) with 57 programmatic exports. It targets individual developers running multiple AI agents, teams standardizing agent configurations, and skill/MCP server authors distributing their work across the ecosystem.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Fragmented Configuration Landscape

The AI coding agent space has exploded from 3-4 tools in 2025 to 28+ distinct agents in early 2026. Each agent has independently invented its own configuration scheme:

- **28 different providers**, each with unique paths, config formats, and directory structures
- **6 different config key names** for the same concept (MCP server registration):
  - `mcpServers` (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Cline, and 16 others)
  - `mcp_servers` (Codex CLI)
  - `extensions` (Goose)
  - `mcp` (OpenCode)
  - `servers` (VS Code)
  - `context_servers` (Zed)
- **4 different config file formats**: JSON, JSONC (with comments), YAML, TOML
- **3 different instruction file conventions**: `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`

### 2.2 Skills Ecosystem Fragmentation

The emerging "Skills" ecosystem (reusable AI agent prompts/instructions packaged as SKILL.md files) has no unified distribution mechanism:

- Multiple competing marketplaces (agentskills.in, skills.sh) with no interoperability
- No standard installation model across agents
- No security scanning for malicious prompt injection in community skills
- No version tracking or update mechanism

### 2.3 MCP Server Configuration Burden

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers must be manually configured in each agent's config file:

- 5 agents require non-standard config transformations (Goose, Zed, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor)
- Remote vs. stdio transports need different config shapes per agent
- No lock file tracking what was installed where
- Installing one MCP server to 5 agents requires editing 5 different files in 5 different formats

### 2.4 Instruction File Management

Teams using multiple agents must maintain parallel instruction files:

- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md`, 25 other agents read `AGENTS.md`
- Keeping shared configuration blocks synchronized across these files is manual and error-prone
- No injection/update mechanism for shared content blocks

### 2.5 Real-World Origin

CAAMP was born from a concrete pain point: the CLEO project maintained 3 diverging registries (`agent-registry.json`, `mcp-config.sh`, `injection-registry.sh`) that each tracked overlapping but inconsistent subsets of the same provider data. CAAMP consolidates all provider knowledge into a single `registry.json`.

---

## 3. Vision Statement

**"One CLI to manage them all."**

CAAMP is the npm/apt/brew of AI agent configuration. Just as npm unified JavaScript package management and homebrew unified macOS software installation, CAAMP unifies the configuration and package management of AI coding agents.

A developer should be able to:
1. Install an MCP server to all their agents with a single command
2. Install a skill to all their agents with a single command
3. Keep instruction files synchronized across agents automatically
4. Discover which agents are installed on their system
5. Search for and audit community skills before installing them
6. Track everything in a lock file for reproducibility

---

## 4. Target Users

### 4.1 AI Tool Power Users

Developers who run 2-5+ AI coding agents simultaneously (e.g., Claude Code for complex tasks, Cursor for quick edits, Gemini CLI for Google ecosystem work). They waste significant time configuring the same MCP servers and skills across multiple tools.

### 4.2 Development Teams

Teams that need standardized agent configurations across all team members. CAAMP's instruction injection and project-level config support enables consistent agent behavior.

### 4.3 Skill and MCP Server Authors

Developers building reusable skills (SKILL.md) or MCP servers who want their work to be installable across all 28 agents without writing per-agent installation instructions.

### 4.4 Framework and Tool Maintainers

Maintainers of AI coding tools who want to understand the provider landscape and ensure compatibility with emerging standards.

### 4.5 DevOps and Platform Engineers

Engineers managing AI agent infrastructure at scale who need programmatic access to provider detection, configuration management, and security auditing.

### Skills Management

4. **US-S01**: As a developer, I want to install a skill from a GitHub repository so that my agents can use community-authored prompts.
5. **US-S02**: As a developer, I want to install a skill to specific agents (not all) so that I can control which agents receive which skills.
6. **US-S03**: As a developer, I want to remove a skill and have it cleaned up from all agents so that uninstallation is complete.
7. **US-S04**: As a developer, I want to list all installed skills (globally and per-project) so that I can inventory my skill set.
8. **US-S05**: As a developer, I want to search marketplaces for skills by keyword so that I can discover useful community skills.

10. **US-S07**: As a developer, I want to validate a SKILL.md file against the standard so that I can ensure my skill is well-formed before publishing.
11. **US-S08**: As a security-conscious developer, I want to audit a skill for prompt injection, command injection, data exfiltration, and other threats so that I can assess risk before installation.
12. **US-S09**: As a CI/CD engineer, I want SARIF-formatted audit output so that I can integrate skill security scanning into my pipeline.
13. **US-S10**: As a developer, I want to check for skill updates so that I can keep my installed skills current.

### MCP Server Management

14. **US-M01**: As a developer, I want to install an MCP server to all my detected agents with a single command so that I do not have to edit each config file manually.
15. **US-M02**: As a developer, I want CAAMP to handle per-agent config transformations automatically (Goose YAML extensions, Zed context_servers, etc.) so that I do not need to know each agent's config schema.
16. **US-M03**: As a developer, I want to remove an MCP server from all agents with a single command so that cleanup is comprehensive.
17. **US-M04**: As a developer, I want to list all configured MCP servers across all my agents so that I have a unified view.
18. **US-M05**: As a developer, I want to auto-detect MCP configurations in my project and global config files so that I can inventory what is already configured.
19. **US-M06**: As a developer, I want a lock file tracking all MCP installs so that I can reproduce my configuration on another machine.

### Instructions Management

20. **US-I01**: As a team lead, I want to inject a shared configuration block into all instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md) so that all agents receive the same project context.
21. **US-I02**: As a developer, I want to check whether instruction injections are current, outdated, or missing so that I can identify drift.
22. **US-I03**: As a developer, I want to update all instruction injections in a single command so that I can keep them synchronized.

### Config Management

23. **US-C01**: As a developer, I want to view the config file for any provider so that I can inspect its current state.
24. **US-C02**: As a developer, I want to get the config file path for any provider so that I can open it in my editor.

### Library API

25. **US-L01**: As a tool author, I want to use CAAMP as a library (not just a CLI) so that I can build custom tooling on top of its provider registry and config management.

## 7. Competitive Landscape

### 7.1 Vercel Skills CLI

**What it does**: Vercel's `skills` CLI provides skill authoring and marketplace publishing, primarily targeting the Vercel ecosystem. It defines the SKILL.md standard that community marketplaces have adopted.

**What CAAMP borrowed**: The SKILL.md file format and frontmatter schema, the concept of marketplace search.

**What CAAMP adds**: Multi-agent support (Vercel's tool is single-agent focused), security auditing with 46 rules and SARIF output, canonical+symlink installation model, lock file tracking, and aggregation of multiple marketplace backends.

### 7.2 Neon `add-mcp`

**What it does**: Neon's `add-mcp` utility simplifies adding a single MCP server to a single agent. It detects your agent and writes the config file.

**What CAAMP borrowed**: The concept of auto-detecting installed agents and writing MCP configs.

**What CAAMP adds**: Multi-agent installation (one command installs to all agents), per-agent config transforms for non-standard agents, lock file tracking, config removal, and support for all 28 providers (not just the most common ones).

### 7.3 Agent Skills Marketplace (agentskills.in)

**What it does**: A web-based marketplace for discovering and browsing community skills. Provides a GitHub-backed directory of SKILL.md files.

**What CAAMP borrowed**: The marketplace API for skill search and discovery.

**What CAAMP adds**: CLI-based installation directly from marketplace search results, security auditing before install, multi-agent targeting, and aggregation with skills.sh for broader coverage.

### 7.4 CAAMP's Unique Position

CAAMP is the **only tool** that combines all four pillars:

| Capability | Vercel Skills | Neon add-mcp | agentskills.in | CAAMP |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Skills install/manage | Partial | No | Browse only | Yes |
| MCP server install | No | Single-agent | No | Multi-agent |
| Instruction injection | No | No | No | Yes |
| Config format handling | No | Partial | No | JSON/JSONC/YAML/TOML |
| Provider registry | No | Limited | No | 28 providers |
| Security auditing | No | No | No | 46 rules, SARIF |
| Lock file tracking | No | No | No | Yes |
| Library API | No | No | No | 57 exports |

## 12. Risks and Mitigations

### 12.1 API Instability

**Risk**: Provider config formats change frequently as agents evolve. A Cursor update could change its MCP config schema.

**Mitigation**: The `registry.json` is human-editable and can be updated independently of code releases. Per-agent transforms are isolated in `src/core/mcp/transforms.ts` making updates surgical.

### 12.2 Marketplace Dependency

**Risk**: agentskills.in or skills.sh could change their APIs, go offline, or become unmaintained.

**Mitigation**: The adapter pattern (`MarketplaceAdapter` interface) isolates marketplace dependencies. Each adapter catches errors independently -- one marketplace going down does not affect the other. New adapters can be added without modifying existing code.

### 12.3 Provider Churn

**Risk**: The 28-agent landscape is volatile. Agents may merge, rebrand, shut down, or new ones may appear rapidly.

**Mitigation**: The single `registry.json` data model makes it trivial to add, update, or deprecate providers. The `status` field supports `active`, `beta`, `deprecated`, and `planned` states for lifecycle management.

### 12.4 Windows Symlink Limitations

**Risk**: Windows has historically restrictive symlink support. The canonical+symlink skill installation model may fail.

**Mitigation**: The installer already includes a fallback chain: symlink -> junction -> copy. This is implemented in `src/core/skills/installer.ts:82-87`.

### 12.5 Config File Corruption

**Risk**: Writing to agent config files could corrupt them, especially JSONC files with comments.

**Mitigation**: Comment-preserving writes via `jsonc-parser` for JSONC files. All config writes use the format-appropriate library (js-yaml for YAML, @iarna/toml for TOML) rather than string manipulation.

### 12.6 Security of Community Skills

**Risk**: Malicious skills could contain prompt injection, command injection, or data exfiltration instructions.

**Mitigation**: The 46-rule audit scanner covers 8 threat categories including prompt injection (8 rules), command injection (8 rules), data exfiltration (6 rules), privilege escalation (4 rules), and more. SARIF output enables CI/CD integration. The audit command runs before installation when requested.

### 12.7 Scaling Beyond 28 Providers

**Risk**: As the provider count grows, the single `registry.json` file could become unwieldy.

**Mitigation**: At the current scale (28 providers, ~720 lines), the file is manageable. If it reaches 50+, a plugin system (P3 roadmap) would allow external provider definitions. The query functions already abstract over the data source.

## 13. Appendices

### Appendix A: Provider Registry Schema

The `Provider` type (`src/types.ts:31-59`) defines the schema for each registry entry:

```typescript
interface Provider {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier (e.g., "claude-code")
  toolName: string;                    // Human-readable name (e.g., "Claude Code")
  vendor: string;                      // Company name (e.g., "Anthropic")
  agentFlag: string;                   // CLI flag value (e.g., "claude-code")
  aliases: string[];                   // Alternate names (e.g., ["claude"])

  pathGlobal: string;                  // Global config directory
  pathProject: string;                 // Project-level config directory

  instructFile: string;                // Instruction file name (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md)

  configKey: string;                   // MCP config key in config file
  configFormat: ConfigFormat;          // json | jsonc | yaml | toml
  configPathGlobal: string;            // Global config file path
  configPathProject: string | null;    // Project config file path (null if unsupported)

  pathSkills: string;                  // Global skills directory
  pathProjectSkills: string;           // Project skills directory

  detection: DetectionConfig;          // How to detect if installed
  supportedTransports: TransportType[];// stdio | sse | http
  supportsHeaders: boolean;            // Whether HTTP headers are supported

  priority: ProviderPriority;          // high | medium | low
  status: ProviderStatus;              // active | beta | deprecated | planned
  agentSkillsCompatible: boolean;      // Whether agent supports SKILL.md
}
```
